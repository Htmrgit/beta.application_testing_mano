# 🧪 Beta Application Testing - Mano

Welcome to **beta.application_testing_mano** — a sandbox environment where experimental features, code snippets, prototypes, and integrations are tested before production rollout.

## 🔍 Purpose

This repository serves as a testing ground for:
- Frontend and backend MVPs
- API integrations and workflow validation
- UI/UX concept trials
- Performance and bug fix testing
- Automation or script experiments

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

Before launching any startup or tool, it's crucial to:
- Test features in isolation
- Break code without fear
- Validate assumptions
- Iterate quickly and securely

This repo helps maintain clean production repositories by keeping experiments separate.
